I am an undergraduate student majoring in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation at Fuzhou University, Fujian, China. During my undergraduate program, my research work focuses on deep learning and machine learning, robotic position guided vision, and robot system development. You can view my resume by clicking here.

Dr. [Gang Mou](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1018/1061.htm) also gave me a lot of help during my undergraduate years. We conducted collaborative research in robotics integrated system development.

I had an internship at Quanzhou Equipment Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences. There, I was supervised by Dr.[Jun Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~121) and Mr.[Yin Gao](http://www.casqiem.ac.cn/doclist.action?chnlid=3167) to learn about image processing and robot control.



Want to design something interesting with me? 
======
I enjoy working on robotic object manipulation, 3D vision and customizing some fun stuff. I can program in Python, MATLAB, linux, and design with Management Software Computer Aided Design.

Since middle school, I have been very interested in robotics and wish I could design a robotic system. In college, I was lucky to have the opportunity to study Mechanical Design and Manufacturing and Automation, which taught me a lot about robotic systems and allowed me to "customize" a lot of interesting things.

I look forward to any interesting cooperation!
