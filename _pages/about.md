I am currently a Bachelor in electronic information engineering from Fuzhou University, Fujian, China. My research interests focus on deep learning, signal processing and AI edge system.

At present, I am an intern in Quanzhou Institute of Equipment, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Here, I accept the guidance of Dr. [Li Jun](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1015/1123.htm/) and Mr. [Yin Gao](http://www.casqiem.ac.cn/doclist.action?chnlid=3167) to learn about image processing and robot control.

I plan to apply for a research-oriented degree in the autumn of 2023 or later semester to engage in in-depth learning, image processing and AI edge computing related research. If you are interested in me and have relevant information, please be sure to contact me!

Want to design something interesting with me? 
======
Since junior high school, I have been very interested in custom design, and I hope I can customize a game console. In college, I was lucky to have the opportunity to learn electronic information engineering, which enabled me to learn a lot about embedded systems and enable me to "customize" many interesting things. If you are interested in my design, you can take a look at some relevant videos I published in [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/25541376?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0/).

I look forward to any interesting cooperation!
