I am currently a Bachelor in electronic information engineering from Fuzhou University, Fujian, China. My research interests focus on deep learning, signal processing and AI edge system. [You can click here to view my resume.](https://shannongsr.github.io/cv/)

During my undergraduate period, I received the guidance of Prof. [Zhijian Lin](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1013/1916.htm) and Prof. [Pingping Chen](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1012/1070.htm) and did some research on machine learning, communication signal processing and AI edge computing.

At the same time, I also got a lot of help from my class adviser, Dr. [Gang Mou](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1018/1061.htm). We have cooperated in the research of image processing.

At present, I am an intern in Quanzhou Institute of Equipment, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Here, I accept the guidance of Dr. [Jun Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~121) and Mr. [Yin Gao](http://www.casqiem.ac.cn/doclist.action?chnlid=3167) to learn about image processing and robot control.


Want to design something interesting with me? 
======
I like to build embedded systems and customize some interesting things. I can use Python, C, C++, MATLAB, Verilog to program. I am good at using MDK v5, Arduino, STM32CubeMX, Altium Designer, etc. to design embedded systems.

Since junior high school, I have been very interested in custom design, and I hope I can customize a game console. In university, I was lucky to have the opportunity to learn electronic information engineering, which enabled me to learn a lot about embedded systems and enable me to "customize" many interesting things. If you are interested in my design, you can take a look at some relevant videos I published in [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/25541376?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0/).

I look forward to any interesting cooperation!
